# Though not required, itâ€™s a good idea to begin the commit message with a
# single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change, followed by
# a blank line and then a more thorough description. The text up to the first
# blank line in a commit message is treated as the commit title, and that title
# is used throughout Git. For example, Git-format-patch(1) turns a commit into
# email, and it uses the title on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in
# the body.
